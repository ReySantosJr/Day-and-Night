# Day-and-Night-JMonkeyEngine-

This program was a project for my CMSC 325 class in UMGC. 
You will need the JMonkeyEngine in order to use it.

*NOTE*

When you donwload the JMonkeyEngine and run the scene, 
make sure to put the textures in the 'assets/Textures/' section of the program

*Scene Description*
The program displays a night time setting as stars in the background, a rotating moon with a tree 
on a small field. A comet will go past the sky every so often too. The optional day time has a 
sunny sky with trees in the back with no moon or comet passing by.

The player can use the WASD keys and mouse too look around the scene. They can also hold 
down the space bar ti switch the default night setting to daytime.
